## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project marked my first time incorporating semantic HTML5. I'm not entirely sure if I applied it correctly, but Iâ€™m confident I'll improve with more experience.

Additionally, I hadn't used the focus class before, so that's a feature I'll definitely keep in mind moving forward.

### Continued development

Knowing how important semantic HTML markup is for the browser, I'll continue refining my skills. I also need more experience using media queries, but I'm sure I'll improve in future projects.
